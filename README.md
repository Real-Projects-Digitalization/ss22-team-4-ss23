## We support social workers in saving time with our solution and focusing on people in need.

## The problem
Social workers face a significant burden in finding emergency shelters for homeless youth. Our project aims to alleviate the workload and facilitate the search process for social workers, providing them with a solution that streamlines and simplifies the task.

## The solution
We provide a centralized program that lists all available social services in one convenient platform.
